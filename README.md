To predict prices 

Introduction
Forecasting stock prices plays an important role in setting a trading strategy or determining the appropriate timing for buying or selling a stock. 
In this project, we use a model, called feature fusion long short-term memory-convolutional neural network (LSTM-CNN) model. 
It combines features learned from different representations of the same data, namely, stock time series and stock chart images, to predict stock prices.
